i'm too heavy
i dropped some stuff and now i'm too light
dropped everything except the weather machine and i'm too light
trying a bunch of possibilities
with everything i'm too heavy
if i drop only weather machine i'm too heavy
if i drop weather machine + food ration i'm too heavy
f i drop weather machine + food ration + ice cream i'm too heavy
drop weather machine + food ration + ice cream + fied point, too heavy
drop weather machine + food ration + ice cream + fixed point + easter egg, too heavy
drop weather machine + food ration + ice cream + fixed point + easter egg + asterisk, too light
drop weather machine + food ration + ice cream + fixced point + asterisk, too light
drop weather machine + ice cream + ficed point + asterisk, too light
drop weather machine + ice cream + fixed point + asterisk + food ration, too light

i need to be carrying at least one of weather machine and asterisk.

easter egg
polygon
food ration
astronaut ice cream
weather machine
dark matter
fixed point
asterisk

2^7 = 128 possibilities

you can definitely get rid of the asterisk, that is too heavy on its own
everything else is fine
down to 64 possibilities

pretty sure everything _except_ the weather machine is too light.  testin gthat now
yes, without the weather machine i am too light

so i must be carrying the weather machine, and i must not carry the asterisk
down to 32 possibilities

try adding in all one-element subsets on top of weather machine
as expected, all weather machines + one more thing result in too light

try adding in all (n-1)-element subsets on top of weather machine
first obvious thing, i'mm too heavy with all of them
without dark matter, i am too light
without everything else, i am too heavy

now i know i can't possibly carry the asterisk, i must carry the weather machine, and i also must carry the dark matter.  otherwise, i am too light

down to 16 possibiltiies ithink
i'll take every one element set on top of weather machine + dark matter

interesting that dark matter + food ration + weather machine is too heavy; this shows i can't possibly carry food ration

all the other one-element sets on top of weather machine + dark matter are too light

try all two element sets on top of weather machine + dark matter that don't meet asterisk or food ration

polygon + fixed point => too light
polygon + ice cream => too heavy
polygon + easter egg => too light
ice cream + fixed point => too heavy

success!
